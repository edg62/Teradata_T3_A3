Aster tablesize and table owner SQL
It's time for our developers to clean up after themselves. I want to produce a list of users, schemas, tables, size. Am I overcomplicating this? I've unsuccessfully tried the following:

CREATE dimension TABLE table_space AS SELECT schema, relname, SUM(size_on_disk)::DOUBLE AS size_on_disk
FROM nc_tablesize_details(ON (SELECT 1) PARTITION BY 1)
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;

SELECT a.*,b.* FROM table_space a, nc_all_tables b, nc_all_schemas c
WHERE a.schema = c.schemaname AND c.schemaid = b.schemaid;
which gave me the error:
SELECT Failed. 34:  (34) ERROR: queries involving both system tables and non-system tables not supported. 
I also tried:

SELECT a.*,b.* FROM (SELECT schema, relname, SUM(size_on_disk)::DOUBLE AS size_on_disk
FROM nc_tablesize_details(ON (SELECT 1) PARTITION BY 1)
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2) a, nc_all_tables b, nc_all_schemas c
WHERE a.schema = c.schemaname AND c.schemaid = b.schemaid;
which gave me:
SELECT Failed. 34:  (34) ERROR: queries involving both system tables and sqlmr functions not supported. 
So I thought I'll just create copies of the system tables and select from them so I tried:

CREATE dimension TABLE all_tabs AS SELECT * FROM nc_all_tables

and found that:
CREATE TABLE Failed. 34:  (34) ERROR: create table statement may not reference system tables.
